## Notes
There are a couple problems with the output provided in the "starter" notebook:

The starter notebook suggests that, after removing duplicate data, there should be 248 mice. I don't think that is correct. You would get 248 mice if you removed ALL rows with the problematic mouse, but that isn't what's called for. There is no "duplicated mouse", there is a mouse with duplicated study entries. Removing rows for those duplicated entries does not remove the mouse. 

To reconcile my output with the rest of the starter notebook's, I have removed the "duplicated" mouse, g989.

Also, the output in the "starter" notebook suggests that Infubinol should 
have an outlier at 31 mm3, but that outlier is missing from the boxplot graph and I don't see any such data point in the provided dataset. So I believe the starter notebook's output is incorrect and that mine is correct.
