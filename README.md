## Notes
The "starter" notebook suggests that, after removing duplicate data, there should be 248 mice. I don't think that is correct. You would get 248 mice if you removed ALL rows with the problematic mouse, but that isn't what's called for.

There is no "duplicated mouse", there is a mouse with duplicated study entries. Removing rows for those duplicated entries does not remove the mouse. 

In other words, mouse G989 had too many entries in the raw data. I removed the redundant ones. Now G989 has the right amount.
